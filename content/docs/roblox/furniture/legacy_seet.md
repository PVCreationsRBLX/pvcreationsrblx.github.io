{{<callout type="warning">}}
The following items are considered **unsupported** and thus will not receive any updates. If you receive a pop-up regarding the chairs having scripts, this is generally because they use a script to compensate for an ages-old issue with anchored Seats; these also **lack support for R15**. The issues with anchored Seats have been resolved for several years. You are free to use them in your projects, although better options exist.

All legacy SEET products.

## Impact

The de-facto replacement for Intent. Released December 2017.

## Intent

Seemingly abstract block arrangements that don't seem to have done too well. Released January 2017.

## Consolidate

Released in 2015.

## Nova

Chairs inspired by Allsteel's Seek line. I tried to be very quirky, which ultimately led to the failure of the first generation released in 2015. A second generation, dubbed **Nova2**, was released in 2017.

**No R15 support for Nova 1**


## Brillia

Released in 2015, facelifted in December 2017 (or was it January 2018?) with **Brillia Series 1.5**. An upholstered variant was also introduced then.

**No R15 support for Series 1**

## Excel

Chairs inspired by Allsteel's Take-5 line. Released in 2015.

**No R15 support**

## Enrich

Huh? Released in 2015.

**No R15 support**

## Flourish I

The venerable Flourish legacy series has cemented itself as SEET's quintessential product line (i.e. the one that's held up better than the rest). First released in 2015 with further variants being released up to 2018.

## Explore

Inspired by Artcobell's Discover series. Not very good. Released in 2015.

**No R15 support**

## Hoist

Released in 2014(?)

**No R15 support**
