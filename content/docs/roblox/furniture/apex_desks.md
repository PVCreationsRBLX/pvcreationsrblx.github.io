**Apex** â€“ a desk set designed to complement the [Flourish II](../flourish_2) chairs.

I started working on Apex in early 2023 and released in the middle of that year.

Largely inspired by the [Silhouette](https://smithsystem.com/lines/silhouette/) series by Smith System, Apex features three book box options, two height options, two width options, and two surface options. All versions are also height-adjustable, although they can only be adjusted in Studio for the time being. Since Release 23.09, all versions of Apex support the use of SurfaceAppearance.
