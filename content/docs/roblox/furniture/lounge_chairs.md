A collection of lounge chairs I made in about five hours. They are heavily based on HON's Grove series and designed with an emphasis on color customization and modularity. There are four versions: single seat, double seat, double seat with middle table, and triple seat. All versions come in three arm styles: no arms, square arms, and tapered arms.
