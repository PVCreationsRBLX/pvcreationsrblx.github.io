**Flourish II** – also known as **Flourish 2** or **Flourish Deux** – the successor to the legendary Flourish collection first introduced in 2015.

I had worked on Flourish II sporadically between August 2022 and May 2023 (lack of time :P), and while I think the original Flourish series aged quite well for an 8-year-old design – better than a lot of my older (and even some newer) furniture designs – but after a while, I felt it was time for its successor.
