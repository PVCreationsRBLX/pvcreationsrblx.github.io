**Flourish II** – also known as **Flourish 2**, **Flourish Series 2**, or **Flourish Deux** – the successor to the legendary Flourish collection first introduced in early 2015 (15 March 2015 to be exact). Its release date was *not* coincidental.

I had worked on Flourish II sporadically between August 2022 and May 2023 (lack of time :P), and while I think the original Flourish series aged quite well for an 8-year-old design – better than a lot of my older (and even some newer) furniture designs – but after a while, I felt it was time for its successor.

The original Flourish was heavily inspired by Artcobell's Alphabet and HON's SmartLink lines, but Flourish II additionally takes inspiration from Virco's Civitas frame, which is used on the manufacturer's Analogy, Sage and ZUMA lines.
