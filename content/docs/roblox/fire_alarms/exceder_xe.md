The **Wheelock Exceder Xenon** collection was first released in mid-2019, with a remastered version releasing in 2022, consisting of heavily facelifted wall-mount devices. If only you could see how awful and bloated they were prior...

Fun fact: This is one of two PVC fire alarm collections to feature an odd number of devices (43), the other being the [MT4](../mt4) (5).

These alarms were tested with moneyLAB's RSA2000 system and should also be compatible with other systems based on that standard.
