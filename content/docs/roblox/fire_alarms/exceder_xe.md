The **Wheelock Exceder Xenon** collection was first released in mid-2019, with a remastered version releasing in 2022, consisting of heavily facelifted wall-mount devices. If only you could see how awful and bloated they were prior...

These alarms were tested with moneyLAB's RSA2000 system and should also be compatible with other systems based on that standard.
