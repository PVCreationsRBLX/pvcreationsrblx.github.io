![LED3 Main](/images/main_led3.webp)

The **Wheelock Exceder LED3** collection is PVC's very first – and largest. It was first released in January 2019, with a remastered version releasing in 2021, consisting of completely remodeled wall-mount devices among other updates. Not to mention lower poly count – that's always nice!

These alarms were tested with moneyLAB's RSA2000 system and should also be compatible with other systems based on that standard.

**IMPORTANT:** With Release 25.04, these alarms now use CollectionService. As such, their scripts have been extensively restructured in a way that means that alarms no longer have individual scripts. All alarms are now controlled by the scripts in the "!Scripts_PVC_P01R" folder. I recommend you place this folder to ServerScriptService, but because the alarms have no module calls – for which scripts are needed – this is by no means essential.

{{ % /details %}}

### Version 25.04 (11 April 2025)

{{% details title="Click me to reveal" closed="true" %}}

* Significant functionality improvements, including:
    * Updated all alarms to use CollectionService and Attributes
    * New attribute entitled "ContVisualCircuit" (boolean). Set to TRUE for strobe to flash continuously or FALSE for the strobe to flash if VisualCircuit is set to 1.

{{% /details %}}

### Version 22.03 (4 March 2022)

{{% details title="Click me to reveal" closed="true" %}}

* Refreshed ceiling-mount devices: new strobe parts, less detailed horn
* More lax license

{{% /details %}}

### Version 21.11 (2 November 2021)

{{% details title="Click me to reveal" closed="true" %}}

* First release under PVC group
* Changes from the legacy edition:
    * Slightly larger scale
    * Traditional horns and horn strobes now have a Temporal 3 tone option that is intended for larger/heavier games that don't wish to use a voice-evacuation system. Of course, the panel-coded option is still there. Note that for the LHN/LHS models, the Temporal 3 option might not be able to keep up with other devices with a Temporal 3 audio.
 * Switched strobes to use the BillboardGui style that has been pretty much traditional since 2013
 * LSPK/LSPST/LFHNK/LFHSH/LFHSK models are now taller than LHN/LHS/LST models, akin to their real-life counterparts
 * Makes use of new task.wait() system instead of wait() which should improve performance when used en masse
 * New models for all 60 wall-mount appliances which are more optimized and accurate (the ceiling-mount devices are not available for the time being; they will be facelifted — but not remodeled — in due course)

### Release Candidate 3.5 (30 July 2019)

* Fixed LHSHW3 models' intensity labels - changed color from white to red
* New free-running API. It waits for a little bit of time before flashing, if at all. All NAs are still synchronized by default, however.
* Improved sounds
