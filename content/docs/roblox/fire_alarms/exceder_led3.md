The **Wheelock Exceder LED3** collection is PVC's very first – and largest. It was first released in January 2019, with a remastered version releasing in 2021, consisting of completely remodeled wall-mount devices among other updates. Not to mention lower poly count – that's always nice!

These alarms were tested with moneyLAB's RSA2000 system and should also be compatible with other systems based on that standard.
