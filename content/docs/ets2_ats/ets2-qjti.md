ETS2-QJTI (short for Euro Truck Simulator 2 Quick Job Truck Improvements), as its name suggest, aims to improve some Quick Job truck configurations for Euro Truck Simulator 2.

See its (in-development) ATS counterpart [here](../ats-qjti).

## Changes

### DAF NGD

* Replaced original 4×2 heavy/oversize configs with 6×4 XG+ config (2021)
* Added 6×4 and 8×4 configs for XFC and XG+ (2021 and 2025)

These configurations are also available at any DAF dealer or the Mod Dealer.

### DAF XD

* Replaced original 4×2 heavy/oversize configs with 6×4 XDC config (2021)
* Added new 2025 6×4 heavy/oversize config

These configurations are also available at any DAF dealer or the Mod Dealer.

### DAF XF Euro 6

* Pre-existing configs now use facelift interiors if they didn’t already
* Added 2012 configs based on the originals

The 2012 configurations will appear in the Used Dealer at random.

### Iveco S-Way

* Configs that originally used metallic paintjobs now use solid ones

### Volvo FH5/6

* Added new 6×4 heavy/oversize configs (standard front only)

The FH5 and 6 do not feature custom beacon options. In their place, the heavy configs use the "Bonfire" beacon from the base game, and the oversize configs use the "Star" beacon from the Special Transport DLC.

This configuration is also available at any Volvo dealer or the Mod Dealer.
