All ETS2 and ATS mods by PV Creations. They're not very big, mind you.

## Installing ETS2/ATS mods

 Save to your respective mods folder. This is usually in `C:\Users\<your name>\Documents\<game>\mod` for Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/<game>/mod` for macOS, or ` ~/".local/share/<game>/mod"` for Linux. This applies to most moddable SCS games.

 **American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 treat .zip files and .scs files equally, so unless mod instructions say otherwise, .zip mods should not be extracted.**

## Mods

{{<callout type="warning">}}
**IMPORTANT:** As of 28 November 2024, Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator has been updated to version 1.53. My mods should have minimal (if any) issues with the new version due to their scope  – and because they, unlike a certain paid truck mod, don't mess with important files – but if you have any issues with them, please let me know!

### American Truck Simulator

**5700XE Sound Patch**

This mod changes the indicator and brake pressure warning sound effects for SCS' Western Star 5700XE to be more accurate. It's just like the pre-2017 Freightliner Cascadia. Apparently this was too laborious for SCS.

Tested with ATS version 1.46 (**minimum version**) and works without issues with version 1.53.

**Buyable E-Tech T**

![Buyable E-Tech T](/images/mod_etecht_buyable.webp)

This mod allows you to buy an E-Tech T of your own – or several, if you so desire. I made this at a rapid pace before learning someone with early access to the truck had already created such a mod.

The config also uses the less powerful 330 kW "engine" option so you don't need to be level 20+ to buy it. You can buy the truck at any Renault dealer or the Mod Dealer, and you might catch one in the Used Truck Dealer as well.

Tested with ETS2 version 1.50 (**minimum version**) and works without issues with version 1.53.

**Additional FH5 & FH6 Transmissions**

(now called **Additional FH4, FH5, and FH6 Transmissions from 22 January 2025**)

This mod adds additional transmissions for the Volvo FH4, FH5 and FH6: I-Shift Dual Clutch (SPO2812A) and I-Shift ATO3512F (FH4/5)/ATO3812G (FH6) with ASO-(UL)C + ARSO-MSR. All are available with or without a retarder.

Tested with ETS2 version 1.53.
