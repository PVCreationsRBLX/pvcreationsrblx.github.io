All ETS2 and ATS mods by PV Creations. They're not very big, mind you.

## Installing ETS2/ATS mods

 Save to your respective mods folder. This is usually in `C:\Users\<your name>\Documents\<game>\mod` for Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/<game>/mod` for macOS, or ` ~/".local/share/<game>/mod"` for Linux. This applies to most moddable SCS games.

 **American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 treat .zip files and .scs files equally, so unless mod instructions say otherwise, .zip mods should not be extracted.**

## Mods

{{<callout type="warning">}}
**IMPORTANT:** As of 19 September 2025, American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 have been updated to version 1.56. My mods should have minimal (if any) issues with the new version, but if you have any issues with them, please let me know!

**5700XE Sound Patch**

This mod changes the indicator and brake pressure warning sound effects for SCS' Western Star 5700XE to be more accurate. It's just like the pre-2017 Freightliner Cascadia. Apparently this was too laborious for SCS.

Tested with ATS version 1.46 (**minimum version**) and works without issues with version 1.55.
