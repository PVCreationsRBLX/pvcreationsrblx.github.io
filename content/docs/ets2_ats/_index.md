All ETS2 and ATS mods by PV Creations. They're not very big, mind you.

## Installing ETS2/ATS mods

 Save to your respective mods folder. This is usually in `C:\Users\<your name>\Documents\<game>\mod` for Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/<game>/mod` for macOS, or ` ~/".local/share/<game>/mod"` for Linux. This applies to most moddable SCS games.

 **American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 treat .zip files and .scs files equally, so unless mod instructions say otherwise, .zip mods should not be extracted.**

## Mods

{{<callout type="warning">}}
**IMPORTANT:** As of 12 September 2024, American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 have been updated to version 1.51. None of my ETS2 mods have been tested with the new version, but unless SCS has changed anything regarding what they affect, their functionality should not be compromised. That being said, use them at your own risk.

If you are running mods that are extremely version-sensitive, such as map mods, you should remain on 1.50 until they have been updated.

### Western Star 5700XE SFX Patch

This mod changes the indicator and brake pressure warning sound effects for SCS' Western Star 5700XE to be more accurate. It's just like the pre-2017 Freightliner Cascadia. Apparently this was too laborious for SCS.

Tested with ATS version 1.46 (**minimum required version**) and works without issues with version 1.51.

### Buyable E-Tech T

![LED3 Main](/images/mod_etecht_buyable.webp)

This mod allows you to buy an E-Tech T of your own â€“ or several, if you so desire. I made this at a rapid pace before learning someone with early access to the truck had already created such a mod.

The config also uses the less powerful 330 kW "engine" option so you don't need to be level 20+ to buy it. You can buy the truck at any Renault dealer or the Mod Dealer.

Tested with ETS2 version 1.50 (**minimum required version**).
