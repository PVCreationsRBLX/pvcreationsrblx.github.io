All ETS2 and ATS mods by PV Creations. They're not very big, mind you.

## Installing ETS2/ATS mods

 Save to your respective mods folder. This is usually in `C:\Users\<your name>\Documents\<game>\mod` for Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/<game>/mod` for macOS, or ` ~/".local/share/<game>/mod"` for Linux. This guide applies to most SCS games with modding support.

 **American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 treat .zip files and .scs files equally, so unless mod instructions say otherwise, .zip mods should not be extracted.**

## Mods

### Western Star 5700XE SFX Patch

This mod changes the indicator and brake pressure warning sound effects for SCS' Western Star 5700XE to be more accurate. It's just like the pre-2017 Freightliner Cascadia. Apparently this was too laborious for SCS.

Tested with ATS version 1.46 (**minimum required version**), but works without issues with version 1.50.

### Buyable E-Tech T

This mod allows you to buy an E-Tech T of your own â€“ or several, if you so desire. I made this at a rapid pace before learning someone with early access to the created such a mod. 

Tested with ETS2 version 1.50 (**minimum required version**).
