ATS-QJTI (short for American Truck Simulator Quick Job Truck Improvements), as its name suggest, aims to improve some Quick Job truck configurations for American Truck Simulator. However, it focuses more on adding new configs to the Quick Job pool than fixing pre-existing ones, which was the primary goal of its [ETS2 counterpart](ets2-qjti).
