title: Additional FH4/5/6 Deflectors
weight: 3
---

This mod adds the rear deflectors (standard and LED) from the FH5/6 Globetrotter XL cabin to the FH4, and those from the FH4 Globetrotter XL cabin to the FH5/6.

**The [FH Tuning Pack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299530/) is required** if you wish to use the LED rear deflectors. However, the mod will still work without the DLC; you simply won't see the LED deflectors in the customization menu.
