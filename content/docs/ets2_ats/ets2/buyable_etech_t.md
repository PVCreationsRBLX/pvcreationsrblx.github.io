This mod allows you to buy an E-Tech T of your own â€“ or several, if you so desire. I made this at a rapid pace before learning someone with early access to the truck had already created such a mod.

The config also uses the less powerful 330 kW "engine" option so you don't need to be level 20+ to buy it. You can buy the truck at any Renault dealer or the Mod Dealer, and you might catch one in the Used Truck Dealer as well.

Tested with ETS2 version 1.50 (**minimum version**) and works without issues with version 1.53.
