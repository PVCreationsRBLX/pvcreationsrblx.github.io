title: S-Way Interior Sound Fix (Temp)
weight: 5
---

This mod was created as an interim solution for [this issue](https://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=2002167) where the Iveco S-Way's interior sounds would conflict with those of the Volvo FH5 and FH6. If you are using ETS2 version 1.54, you should remove this mod from your mods folder as SCS fixed the issue with that version, making it obsolete.
