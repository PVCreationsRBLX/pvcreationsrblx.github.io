title: S-Way Interior Sound Fix (Temp)
weight: 5
---

This mod is an interim solution for [this issue](https://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=2002167) where the Iveco S-Way's interior sounds conflict with those of the Volvo FH5 and FH6. It will likely be fixed by SCS with ETS2 1.54, so once it's released, this mod should still work, but you should remove it from your mods folder as there will be no need for it.

If you don't want its engine sounds to conflict with those trucks as well, use an engine sound mod for the S-Way.
