title: FH6 Headlight Guard Fix 
weight: 6
---

This is a quick fix for this issue where the only headlight guards available for the FH6 are those designed for the Aero front end. With this mod, this adds to the FH6 the headlight guards originally designed for the FH5. However, the FH5's headlight guards have been tweaked so that they will no longer work with the Heavy Duty Bumper to the different headlight design; this also applies to the FH6.

**The [Forest Machinery DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4159240/) is required.**
