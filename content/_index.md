## Welcome to PV Creations
How does this work? Not a clue.

## Caveats
PV Creations is not run by someone with a wealth of web development experience. This site is largely created with a static site generator (Hugo) and a theme I found on its theme webpage. My overconfidence led me to a lot of frustration, which I think paid off â€“ to a degree, as this isn't a great site. The alternative would have been an even worse Weebly/Wix site that borderline INSISTS I create a "cool" site instead of something subdued and basic. Not to mention all the cool kids have those `.github.io` domains ðŸ˜Ž
