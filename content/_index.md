# Welcome to PV Creations

![Building](images/main.webp)

How does this work? Not a clue.


## About this site
This website is designed to be a reference for all things PV Creations. It's going to be quite detailed, containing tidbits about a lot of things that probably wouldn't fit elsewhere.

## Feedback
Questions? Comments? Want to report an issue with the site? Feel free to leave your feedback in the [PVC Discord server](https://discord.gg/kFckVRv56b). Some of you are way better at this than I am!

## Caveats
{{<callout type="warning">}}
This site is, most importantly, a **work in progress**. If you're looking for anything polished, the best you'll get is a polished turd.

PV Creations is not run by someone with a wealth of web development experience. This site is largely created with a static site generator (Hugo) and a theme I found on its theme site. My overconfidence led me to a lot of frustration, which I think paid off â€“ to a degree.
