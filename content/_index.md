# Welcome to PV Creations

![Hi](images/main.webp "The gymnasium of Valenta High School, a school that has been in development hell its entire life. You won't find this there, though.")

How does this work? Not a clue.


## About this site
This website is designed to be a reference for all things PV Creations. It's going to be quite detailed, containing tidbits about a lot of things that probably wouldn't fit elsewhere.

## Caveats
{{<callout type="warning">}}
This site is, most importantly, a **work in progress**. If you're looking for anything polished, the best you'll get is a polished turd.
{{</callout>}}

PV Creations is not run by someone with a wealth of web development experience. This site is largely created with a static site generator (Hugo) and a theme I found on its theme site. My overconfidence led me to a lot of frustration, which I think paid off â€“ to a degree, as this isn't a great site. The alternative would have been an even worse Weebly/Wix/Carrd/whatever site that borderline INSISTS I create a "cool" site instead of something subdued and basic. Not to mention all the cool kids have those `.github.io` domains ðŸ˜Ž

Feel free to leave your feedback in the [PVC Discord server](https://discord.gg/kFckVRv56b). Some of you are way better at this than I am!

## Thanks
