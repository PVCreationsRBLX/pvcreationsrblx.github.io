## About PV Creations

PV Creations was created in June 2021 as a centralized location for all Roblox assets created by PenguinvilleRescue1. After a while, it ended up morphing into something a little bit more.

From 2025, PV Creations gradually began shifting away from Roblox assets and began producing mods for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator. <!-- Because Roblox banned Schlep, smeared him, and later made hundreds of millions of experiences unplayable as a result of their long-term negligence. -->
