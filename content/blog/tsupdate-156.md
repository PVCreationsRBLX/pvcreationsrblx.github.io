title: ETS2/ATS Mod Status (1.56)
---

Long overdue, but it appears that all currently supported mods for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator work without issues with the 1.56 update.

An undocumented change with 1.56 was that FMOD was updated from version 2.02.25 to 2.03.09. A select few sound mods may be impacted by this change. I haven't produced any, but others have, so check with them to see if they need updating.

You can see all mods [here](/docs/ets2_ats/).
