title: ETS2/ATS Mod Status (1.58)
---

ETS2-QJTI release 26.01 has some issues with the 1.58 update. This is due to SCS changing some things around with the Scania R & S with this update. Older releases, however, should work fine. SCS already fixed the issue that version intended to fix, so that override will be removed with the next update anyway.

It appears that all other currently supported mods for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator work without issues with the 1.58 update.

You can see all mods [here](/docs/ets2_ats/).
