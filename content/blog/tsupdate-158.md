title: ETS2/ATS Mod Status (1.58)
---

Since ATS 1.58 came out yesterday and ETS2 1.58 is apparently coming out tomorrow, figured I'd write this.

[ETS2-QJTI](/docs/ets2_ats/ets2/ets2-qjti) release 26.01 has some issues with the 1.58 update. This is due to SCS changing some things around with the Scania R & S with this update. Older releases, however, should work fine. SCS already fixed the issue that version intended to fix, so that override will be removed with the next update anyway.

~~I will also need to verify if [FH6 Headlight Guard Fix](/docs/ets2_ats/ets2/fh6_hl_fix) needs tweaking.~~ **UPDATE FEB 12, 2026:** This mod is now obsolete with 1.58.

It appears that all other currently supported mods for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator work without issues with the 1.58 update.

You can see all mods [here](/docs/ets2_ats/).
