A rebrand was long overdue.

But first, here's the backstory of the original PV Creations logo.

## The original logo

I created PV Creations' original logo in 2021 on an app called Vectornator (now known as [Linearity Curve](https://www.linearity.io/curve/)). The logo comprises the letters "PVC" enclosed in a circle. The logo received a few tweaks over the years, but its fundamanetals remained unchanged. I originally intended that the logo was change color over time, but this was quickly abandoned and the original purple gradient stuck. This was later changed to a solid purple envisaged as an "in-between" of the two.

The original logo was never available in SVG format, not because of some technical limitation, but because 1. I didn't know how to edit SVG files using a text editor (doesn't help that TextEdit sucks) and 2. I never thought I'd need one.

At the end of 2023 I got a "new" Windows PC. Unfortunately Linearity Curve is only available for the iPad and Mac. I don't have an iPad, and my Mac had become unbearably slow. I never took the opportunity to vectorize it, although I probably should've.

## The new logo

Most importantly PV Creations' new logo isn't too different from the original, but I made a few changes:
* **Typeface**: Agency FB replaces Poppins as the PVC logo's font. A condensed font (at least on Windows), Agency FB takes up more vertical space within the circle, making the logo more visually appealing and – in my opinion, at least – proportional. 

...and that's about it. It's already live as the Discord server's icon and will be rolled out to other PVC outlets in due course. Let me know what you think in the Discord server!
