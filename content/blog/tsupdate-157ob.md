title: ETS2 Mod Status (1.57 Open Beta)
---

I'm not sure if any mods need updating at the moment – probably not. At the time I'm writing this, I'm currently downloading the open beta for ETS2 1.57.

Depending on how this update affects the Scania R and S Quick Job trucks, which were [updated with this version](https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/11/ets2-157-scania-r-s-trucks-update.html), ETS2-QJTI *may* receive an update related to them. ETS2-QJTI never affected these trucks, so the current version should still work with 1.57.

You can see all mods [here](/docs/ets2_ats/).
